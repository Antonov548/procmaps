# procmaps

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of procmaps is to help determine which library or other region is mapped to a specific address of a process.
It is the equivalent of `/proc/self/maps` as a data frame, and is designed to work on all major platforms.


## Installation

You can install the released version of procmaps from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("procmaps")
```

## Example

This is what `/proc/self/maps` looks like when this document is rendered:

```{bash}
cat /proc/self/maps
```

This package provides the equivalent as a data frame:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(procmaps)
procmap_get()
```
